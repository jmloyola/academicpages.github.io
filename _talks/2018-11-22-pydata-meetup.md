I gave a short talk titled "Búsqueda de Patrones en Texto" (in english, "Search for patterns in text") as part of a [PyData San Luis MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/PyData-San-Luis/events/256472954/), "Introducción a la computación científica con Python" (in english, "Introduction to scientific computing with Python").

In this talk, I introduced shortly the problem of pattern search in text.
The example we used to understand this problem was the searching of telephone numbers in a big text file.
We introduced the naive approach to solve this problem, remarking its flaws.
Finally, we showed how to use regular expressions, making use of the package `re` in Python, to solve this problem.
