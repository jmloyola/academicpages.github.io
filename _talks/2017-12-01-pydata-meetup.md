I gave a talk at the [PyData San Luis MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/PyData-San-Luis/events/241415480/) titled "Introducción al Aprendizaje Automático" (in english, "Introduction to Machine Learning".

<br>

In this talk, I introduced shortly the history, problems and applications of Machine Learning.
I guided the assistants to implemented the algorithm of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) for image classification. 
This exercise helped understand the basic image classification pipeline.
